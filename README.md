## Why do it exists?

I strongly believe that repetitive and boring processes should be done by machines. Humans should use their beautiful minds to create things that machines can't (yet). Farming in Pokemon Planet is such a repetitive task so I created this farming machine.

## How it behaves?

- It walk in circles until a pokemon appears
- If the pokemon was already caught then it will be killed
- If the pokemon wasn't caught ...

### Things to improve
